# DMCA Policy

This policy describes the information that codedin.wales needs in order to process a DMCA takedown request. Due to the type of content codedin.wales hosts (mostly software code) and the way that content is managed (with Git), we need complaints to be as specific as possible. These guidelines are designed to make the processing of alleged infringement notices as straightforward as possible. Our form of notice set forth below is consistent with the form suggested by the DMCA statute, which can be found at the U.S. Copyright Office's official website: http://www.copyright.gov.

As with all legal matters, it is always best to consult with a professional about your specific questions or situation. We strongly encourage you to do so before taking any action that might impact your rights. This guide isn't legal advice and shouldn't be taken as such.

### Submitting your DMCA
You can send an email notification to [copyright@codedin.wales](mailto:copyright@codedin.wales). You may include an attachment if you like, but please also include a plain-text version of your letter in the body of your message.

If you must send your notice by physical mail, you can do that too, but please note that it may take substantially longer for us to receive and respond to it. Notices we receive via plain-text email have a much faster turnaround than PDF attachments or physical mail. If you still wish to mail us your notice, our physical address is:

	Attn: DMCA Agent
	PiCymru c/o TechHub Swansea,
	211 High Street, Swansea, United Kingdom, SA1 1NW
